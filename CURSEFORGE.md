## Description (paste into CurseForge in Markdown mode)

AutoSay automatically sends greetings, farewells, and reconnect messages in party, raid, and guild chat. Never forget to say hello or goodbye again!

### Features

- **Per-Channel Config** — independent settings for Party, Raid, and Guild
- **Smart Triggers** — on self join, others join, reconnect, leave, logout
- **Built-in Messages** — a variety of greetings, farewells, and reconnect messages out of the box
- **Custom Messages** — up to 10 per channel per message type, each with its own on/off toggle
- **Random Selection** — picks randomly from your enabled pool (presets + custom combined)
- **Player Names** — optionally include joining player's name in greetings
- **Cooldown Queue** — messages blocked by cooldown are saved and sent later with automatic name merging
- **Cooldown System** — separate cooldowns for guild and group (0-60s, default: 5s)
- **Simulation Mode** — test all triggers and preview messages without actually sending them
- **Window Persistence** — settings window size and position saved across sessions
- **Profile Support** — different configs per character
- **Slash Commands** — `/autosay` or `/as`

### Quick Start
